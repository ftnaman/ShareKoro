# Share Koro

**Share Koro** is a full-stack web service that enables individuals within a neighborhood or community to **lend and borrow physical items** across a variety of categoriesâ€”such as tools, books, appliances, electronics, and household items. The platform is designed to promote resource efficiency, reduce waste, and foster a sense of trust and cooperation among users.

Essentially, Share Koro functions as a **peer-to-peer rental and lending system**, where users can:
- List their personal items for others to borrow
- Browse available items by category or keyword
- Book items for specific dates
- Rate and review lending experiences
- Track item condition and history
- Handle transactions securely, with refund and platform fee mechanisms built in

By combining a user-friendly interface with powerful backend functionality, Share Koro offers a sustainable and community-driven alternative to buying infrequently used items. It is particularly useful for densely populated areas, student housing, or small local communities where shared ownership can significantly reduce both cost and clutter.
